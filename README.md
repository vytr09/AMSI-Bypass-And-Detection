This repository contains tools for both bypassing and detecting AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) modifications. It includes two main components:

## Components

### 1. AMSI-Bypass
A collection of AMSI bypass techniques for educational purposes. These techniques demonstrate various ways AMSI can be bypassed, helping security researchers understand potential vulnerabilities.
